<h1>Cancel “Cancel Culture”</h1>
<hr/>
  <p>The website is called cancel “cancel culture” because it aims to prevent people from being affected heavily by cancel culture, which has been popularized in recent years in several social media platforms, being most prominent on Twitter.</p
    
    <p>The first webpage would be a body page which would have the main text and message that we would want to portray which would encourage the reader to not be affected by other people’s opinions. This would help them to be able to not cause any harm to themselves. The other webpage would be a contacts page which would provide hotlines for suicide prevention and other numbers for those purposes. The next one would provide the person with our contact information if there would be any changes needed to make. The fourth one provides the users with a frequently asked questions page where most questions about the website, its purpose, and its content would be answered. Finally, the final page would be a learn more page which can recommend other good articles to help people’s mental health.</p>
